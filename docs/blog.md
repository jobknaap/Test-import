Today I stayed at home because I wasn't feeling that great sadly I also didn't work on my project, which is a big shame.
**What I learned :** I learned that I don't work well at home, my motivation is almost gone and I prefer to watch youtube and game. So for the future I will attend to school to help with my motivation.

Today was the first day to work on our project I started off by working on the database and the website. It was a very long time ago since I coded html/css so I was bit rusty, had to look up a lot of basic things. But after a while it started to come back to me. I also tested with some PHP, just some basic GET request from the database to retrieve my data. And after that I started to design my webpage more.
**What I learned:** As I stated before a lot of re-learning old html/css, luckily didn't run in any issues. And also having to design an ERD was quite fun, here is an example of the design and this wednesday I will be asking some feedback from mats to improve my design.

### Bootcamp (week1)
I only started this blog in the seccond week of school so sadly i'm not sure what i did every day, so for the first week it will be a summary.<br>
The first week was a bootcamp week which means that we learned something new everyday.<br>
- **First day:** We practiced gitlab, markdown and mkdocs. First we had 2 online workshops where we learned how to use gitlab and markdown. After we finished those workshop we got started on setting up our blueprint page and how to use it.<br>
  - <u>what I learned:</u> I learned a lot about git because of the amazing online workshop created by mats. everything else was quite straight forward.<br>
- **Seond day:** We got our kits from school which got me really excited and because I had experience because of my study, I was able to work ahead from the rest of the class. We soldered our Wemos and made some simple programs to check if it worked and that we understand our devices.<br>
  - <u>What I learned:</u> Not that much to be honest, I did infact had a bit of trouble connecting my wemos. After a bit of patients it worked out, the files I had to add through a link took a little while to display in the arduino enviroment.<br>
- **Third day:** We had to install docker which was quite the hassle. Because with windows there was an issue with a missing enviroment path. I asked the teacher for some advice and he said I had to google to the python directory and in that file I would find docker. After finding the correct path I added it to the enviroment and it worked. Then when starting the docker container I ran in to the issue that port 80 wasn't working. After asking mats he helped me clear up the 80 port. Now everything works perfectly.<br>
  - <u>What I learned:</u> Didn't learn that much, it was mostly just following the steps. I do now know how to add enviroment paths and to clear up my ports.<br>
-  **Fourth day:** We got to learn 3D printing but it was really simplified which I like because modeling etc. Is very difficult. We had to search premade models, change the settings and then upload them on a usb-drive to see the magic happen. It was fun seeing it come to life.<br>
   -  <u>What I learned:</u> I learned a bit about the settings and time management, but that is just about it.
