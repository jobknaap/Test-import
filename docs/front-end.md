### CSS
I made one file ![app.css file](/individual-project-docker-main/web/static/css/app.css) which has design elements that are global like the navigation bar and in the future the footer.
Then I have separate per individual page for the styling.<br>
![index.css file](/individual-project-docker-main/web/static/css/index.css) for the login page.<br>
![tracker.css file](/individual-project-docker-main/web/static/css/tracker.css) for the tracker page.<br>
![admin.css file](/individual-project-docker-main/web/static/css/admin.css) for the admin page.
